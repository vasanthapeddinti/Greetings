# Greetings

Greetings project is written to greet you when you login to your
shell prompt. Depending on your Operating system and your preferred
shell, you can edit your startup script to add the binary that we 
generated by compiling the source code. 

Following image shows different startup script files:

The program final_greetings.c is the final version which combines 
all the features to greet. Rest of the files build each of the features
individually and improve gradually.

The project is a learning from Tiny C projects by Dan Gookin and modified. 

# Prerequisites
```
apt install clang
```

# Compilation steps
```
clang -Wall final_greetings.c -o /root/do_not_delete/greetings
/root/do_not_delete/greetings Vasantha
```

Since the project is implemeneted on linux system, I used bash_profile

# Add the following to startup script
```
root@vasantha-ubuntu-devserver:~# cat ~/.bash_profile 
#!/bin/sh

# startup greetings
/root/do_not_delete/greetings Vasantha
```
